While the two methods look completely different, Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) serve the same purpose. A CLI allows a person to perform tasks on their computer, such as creating files or opening programs, using a series of coded commands. A GUI does the same thing through interactive graphics, such as windows, scrollbars, buttons, and icons.  These graphics can be clicked on and otherwise interacted with. Some operating systems will only use CLI while others utilize both. 
Due to its visual nature, GUI is very friendly to those with little to no knowledge of technology and requires less technical precision to get a desired result. It will also display the desired application or file as the file type it is, be it a text document, video, or image. CLI, on the other hand, is comparatively more difficult to use as it requires knowledge of coding and more technical precision. It will not visually display the application or file the user is looking for and instead only shows plaintext and file extensions. Another difference between the two is where they are operated. With a GUI, the user can interact with it anywhere on the computer screen while CLI can only be used in a command prompt.
