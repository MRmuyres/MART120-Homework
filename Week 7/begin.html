            Friendship with the creature is easy. 
            Simply hold out your hand and wait for him to reciprocate.

            Data entry #1: 
            The odd animal approached me. I think it sniffed my hand but it does not have a visible nose, or a mouth for that matter. 
            Despite my first encounter, the animal looks to be docile. Its long arms appear to have skin-covered claws. 
            I can't imagine they would be useful for fighting.
            From the little information I have gathered, I have learned that the animal likes looking at interesting things. 
            It's partial to shiny materials and objects with visible texture.
