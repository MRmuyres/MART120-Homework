Backgrounds were made in Canva using public domain images. 
All other artwork was made by me. 

This project is part of a larger concept that I have been working on called EGOIST. 
I have been wanting to make a psychological horror game for many years now and feel that this is an appropriate first steps towards accomplishing my goals. I hope you enjoy the glimpse of what could be. 
If you are interested in watching EGOIST's development, please join the game's Discord server.
