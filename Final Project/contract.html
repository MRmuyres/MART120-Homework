        <h2>PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES LIABILITY WAIVER</h2>
        <p>I, [Client Name], hereby acknowledge and accept the following terms and conditions regarding the psychological services provided to me by Dr. Simone Nussbaum:

            Assumption of Risk:
             I understand and acknowledge that engaging in psychological services carries inherent risks, including but not limited to emotional distress, exacerbation of pre-existing conditions, and unforeseen psychological reactions.

            Release of Liability: 
            I hereby release, waive, discharge, and covenant not to sue Dr. Simone Nussbaum, their affiliates, employees, agents, successors, and assigns from any and all liability, claims, demands, actions, and causes of action whatsoever arising out of or related to any loss, damage, or injury, including death, that may be sustained by me, whether caused by the negligence of the psychologist or otherwise.

            Indemnification: 
            I agree to indemnify and hold harmless Dr. Simone Nussbaum, their affiliates, employees, agents, successors, and assigns from any loss, liability, damage, or costs, including court costs and attorney fees, incurred as a result of my participation in psychological services.

            Confidentiality Waiver: 
            I understand that while Dr. Simone Nussbaum will make reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality, there are limitations to confidentiality, including but not limited to situations where there is an imminent risk of harm to myself or others. I waive any right to confidentiality regarding such disclosures.

            Experimental Treatments: 
            I acknowledge that Dr. Simone Nussbaum may utilize experimental or unconventional treatments as part of their practice, and I agree to participate in such treatments at my own risk.

            Financial Responsibility: 
            I agree to be financially responsible for all fees and charges associated with the psychological services provided to me, including but not limited to session fees, assessment fees, and any additional services rendered.

            No Guarantees:
            I understand that Dr. Simone Nussbaum makes no guarantees or assurances regarding the outcomes of the psychological services provided to me, and I acknowledge that results may vary.

            Waiver of Right to Sue: 
            I waive any right to bring a lawsuit or other legal action against Dr. Simone Nussbaum for any reason whatsoever arising out of or related to the psychological services provided to me.

            Governing Law: 
            This waiver shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflicts of law principles.

            Severability: 
            If any provision of this waiver is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected or impaired thereby.
